## Extracting background
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Using the algorithm in [(Zoran Zivkovic, 2006)](http://www.zoranz.net/Publications/zivkovicPRL2006.pdf) to extract background information in each video record.

All video were recorded on 50fps, 
For those pixels grayness values change with time are treated as the effective observation widows (effective pixels).
