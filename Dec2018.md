### Extracting background
Using the algorithm in [(Zoran Zivkovic, 2006)](http://www.zoranz.net/Publications/zivkovicPRL2006.pdf) to extract background information in each video record. Examples for extracted background for each concentrations are shown as follow (white area is the effective window, and black pixels are background).

      )
### Preparing training data
All video were recorded on 50fps, and for each video, extracting the frames and backgrouds at 10-frame interval. The slurry was feed by a peristaltic pump, which means that the frames that in a same acquired video have different appearance. To minimise the undesirable fluctuation effect, each training input take the average of every 25 frames and the effective pixels in 25 backgrounds which equivalent to 5s recording. The pre-processing procedure is shown in the following diagram:

      )
In total, 301 videos were recorded and used for training and validation purpose, while the other 42 diveos were processed for testing. 
**(thess videos were recorded on different days and isolated with training and valisation videos)**
After pre-processing, there are 37582 training samples and 3000 valisation samples in 21 classes, from 0 wt% to 0.5 wt% at 0.025 wt% interval. The testing dataset also covers the whole 21-class range and has 1810 samples in total. All input images are resized to size of 256X256X1 (Length, Width, Channel) to reduce the computational cost. The below graph shows one training input for each concentration class:
