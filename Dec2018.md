## Extracting background
Using the algorithm in [(Zoran Zivkovic, 2006)](http://www.zoranz.net/Publications/zivkovicPRL2006.pdf) to extract background information in each video record. Examples for extracted background for each concentrations are shown as follow (white area is the effective window, and black pixels are background).

      )
All video were recorded on 50fps, 
For those pixels grayness values change with time are treated as the effective observation widows (effective pixels).
