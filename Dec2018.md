# 1. Preprocess video records
### Samples of original frames for each concentration:

## Extracting background
Using the algorithm in [(Zoran Zivkovic, 2006)](http://www.zoranz.net/Publications/zivkovicPRL2006.pdf) to extract background information in each video record. Examples for extracted background for each concentrations are shown as follow (white area is the effective window, and black pixels are background).

## Preparing training data
All video were recorded on 50fps, and for each video, extracting the frames and backgrouds at 10-frame interval. The slurry was feed by a peristaltic pump, which means that the frames that in a same acquired video have different appearance. TO minimise the undesirable fluctuation effect, each training input take the average of every 50 frames and the effective pixels in 50 backgrounds. The pre-processing procedure is shown in the following diagram:
